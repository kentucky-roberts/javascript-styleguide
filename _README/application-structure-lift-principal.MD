### Application Structure LIFT Principal

Structure your app such that you can Locate your code quickly, Identify the code at a glance, keep the Flattest structure you can, and Try to stay DRY. The structure should follow these 4 basic guidelines.

Why LIFT?: Provides a consistent structure that scales well, is modular, and makes it easier to increase developer efficiency by finding code quickly. Another way to check your app structure is to ask yourself: How quickly can you open and work in all of the related files for a feature?

When I find my structure is not feeling comfortable, I go back and revisit these LIFT guidelines

<ul>
<li>Locating our code is easy</li>
<li>Identify code at a glance</li>
<li>Flat structure as long as we can</li>
<li>Try to stay DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) or T-DRY</li>
</ul>
